## What is XCOM Enemy Eternal?
XCOM Enemy Eternal is a tactical, skirmish-size wargame that immerses players in the high-stakes conflict between humanity and extraterrestrial forces. Drawing inspiration from the XCOM video game franchise, it allows players to command elite squads from various factions across the series, such as XCOM soldiers, ADVENT forces, the alien invaders, and other factions. The game is built around strategic, squad-based engagements on a scale that emphasizes small units, tight tactics, and high tension, where every move could spell victory or disaster. Each faction has its own unique abilities and units, ensuring diverse playstyles and strategies in the battle for Earth's future.
